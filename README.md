## Documentation

### Using money cast in the model

The price field can be cast into Money instance. To make it castable, add the following code to your model.

```php
/**
 * The attributes that should be cast.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $casts = [
    'price' => \Nevadskiy\Money\ValueObjects\Money::class,
];
``` 


Also, you need to add the following fields to the model's database table.

```php
Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->bigInteger('price_amount')->unsigned();
    $table->foreignUuid('price_currency_id')->constrained('currencies');
});
```


## Seed currencies 

```bash
php artisan currencies:seed
```

- [ ] add possibility to render money in custom formats (example: '%SU% %code%', '%code% %SU%')
- [ ] store currency rates history and add config for pruning (i.e. 'keep_history' => '1 year') (can be done using laravel prunable models)
- [ ] add install instruction about cron registration for rates
